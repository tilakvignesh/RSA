# RSA
This repo consists of the code which gives u the private and public keys given input prime numbers


The Code calculates all the possible public keys for the given prime numbers and then calculates the corresponding private keys, because of this the code can take a fair amout of time. If you just want one of the public and private keys, the code does not need a lot of change.
